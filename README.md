## Installation via Docker
1. Download the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml).

2. _Optional_: 

    Configure your Bonsai instance to use HTTPS and external auth for better security.
    This requires a bit of work, so if you are just playing around you can skip this step.

    Create a [Facebook Authorization App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/facebook-logins?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=aspnetcore2x) (or Google, Yandex or Vkontakte).

    Modify `docker-compose.yml`:

    * Save Facebook authorization credentials to `Auth__Facebook__AppId` and `Auth__Facebook__AppSecret` config properties
    * Set `Auth__AllowPasswordAuth=false` if you want to disable the less-secure password authorization
    * Replace `@@YOUR_EMAIL@@` with your email address (for LetsEncrypt auto-SSL)
    * Replace `@@DOMAIN@@` with the domain name to use (or you can use your IP with xip.io, like `192.168.1.1.xip.io`)
    * Uncomment two lines with ``Host(`@@DOMAIN@@`)``
    * Comment two lines with ``PathPrefix(`/`)`` 

3. Bring everything up using `docker compose`:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. After everything is brought up Bonsai will listen on ports 80 and 443.

## Development (on Windows)

For development, you will need the following:

* [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1): the main runtime for Bonsai

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (10+)
2. Install [PostgreSQL server](https://www.openscg.com/bigsql/postgresql/installers.jsp/) (9.6+)
3. Download [ffmpeg shared binaries](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) for your system and extract the archive's contents into `External/ffmpeg` folder in the solution root (must contain both `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` executables).
4. Create a file called `appsettings.Development.json`, add the connection string:

    ```
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "Database": "Server=127.0.0.1;Port=5432;Database=bonsai;User Id=<login>;Password=<password>;Persist Security Info=true"
      },
      "Auth": {
	    "AllowPasswordAuth": true
      } 
    }
    ```

5. _Optional, but suggested_:

    Create a [Facebook Authorization App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/facebook-logins?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=aspnetcore2x) (or Google, Yandex or Vkontakte).

	Add the retrieved authorization credentials to the `appsettings.Development.json` and set `AllowPasswordAuth` to `false`:

	```
	{
	    "Auth": {
		    "AllowPasswordAuth": false,
		    "Facebook": {
			  "AppId": "<...>",
			  "AppSecret": "<...>" 
			},
			"Google": {
			  "ClientId": "<...>",
			  "ClientSecret": "<...>" 
			},
			"Yandex": {
			  "ClientId": "<...>",
			  "ClientSecret": "<...>" 
			},
			"Vkontakte": {
			  "ClientId": "<...>",
			  "ClientSecret": "<...>" 
			}
		}
	}
	```
    
6. Create the database:

    ```
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
7. Build the styles and scripts:

    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
8. Run the app (as Visual Studio project or using `dotnet run`).

## Security considerations

### Data backup

If you value the data that you store in Bonsai, make sure that you **SET UP BACKUPS**.

You will need to back up the following:

* Database (approximately tens of megabytes)
* Uploaded media in `wwwroot/media` (may contain gigabytes of data)

There are many options available, free and paid: uploading to a cloud storage, copying to external drives, etc. Please consider your usage/budget and select a combination that works best for you.

backup for docker:

```bash
sudo docker stop bonsai_bonsai_1
sudo docker exec -t -u postgres bonsai_postgres_1 pg_dumpall -c -U bonsai > /path/to/backup/bonsai_postgres_1.sql
sudo docker start bonsai_bonsai_1
```

and you can restore database with commands:

in folder with docker-comopse.yml 

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
sudo docker stop bonsai_bonsai_1
cat /path/to/backup/bonsai_postgres_1.sql | docker exec -i bonsai_postgres_1 psql -U bonsai
sudo docker start bonsai_bonsai_1
```

If you used the default docker compose file, you do not need to change anything, otherwise you will have to change the container names and/or database user credentials

For images, everything is simpler, you need to map the directory with the photo to the host file system, then you can copy / archive the photos in any way you like

```yml
...
bonsai:
  ...
  volumes:
    /path/to/your/images:/app/wwwroot/media
  ...
...
```
and you can remove:

```yml
volumes:
  ...
  images: {}
```

### Authorization methods

Bonsai features two authorization methods: OAuth and password authorization.

OAuth is the preferred method: it's easier to use for end users, more secure and versatile. **Please use the OAuth method if you can!**
For OAuth, you will need to create an authorization app on [Facebook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/facebook-logins?view=aspnetcore-3.0), [Google](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/google-logins?view=aspnetcore-3.0), [Vkontakte](https://vk.com/editapp?act=create) or [Yandex](https://oauth.yandex.ru/client/new) as described in the installation steps.
You can enable multiple authorization apps at the same time: users will pick the one they prefer.

As a fallback, you can also create an account with classic login/password authorization. It can be used for two purposes:

* Playing around with Bonsai (easier to set up: no auth app and https configuration required)
* Giving access to elder family members who don't have a social network account

Please keep the following facts in mind:

* Any user account can only have one authorization method: password, or Facebook, or Google, etc.
* It is not possible to change the authorization type for an account once it has been created.
* Password-based accounts can be locked out if there are too many consecutive failed login attempts.
* Account password can only be reset by an administrator manually. If you only have one admin account, it is password-based, and the password is lost - there's no way to regain access besides direct database manipulation!
